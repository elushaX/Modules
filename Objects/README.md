 Objects

Objects are simple structures with run-time type information attached. <br>

## Features
- Encapsulates most of the basic [types](https://github.com/IlyaShurupov/types.git) into primitives.
- Has its own scripting language to manipulate those objects at run-time.
- Can save and load any object at any point in execution.

## TODO
- Dubug information support
- Run-time error handling
- Dead code elimination & optimization

## Building
1. [Types](https://github.com/IlyaShurupov/types.git) repository must be in the same directory.
2. Export the parent path to the system variables.
```
setx SRC_DIR "parent path"
```
